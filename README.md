# NeuCnt3D

**NeuCnt3D** (3D Neuron Count) is an unsupervised Python tool for multiscale
neuronal body count in large high-resolution volume images acquired
by two-photon scanning or light-sheet fluorescence microscopy.

## Key features

* unsupervised blob detection via Laplacian of Gaussian or Difference of Gaussian kernels
* parallel multiscale analysis of basic image slices
* able to handle large tiled microscopy reconstructions
